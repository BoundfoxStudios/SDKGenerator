These are PlayFab internal bat scripts used by our internal Jenkins server.

They're not sensitive files, and it's convienient to have them in this repo. But they're also not designed to be public.

Feel free to browse, or borrow our ideas, but it is extremely unlikely you'll use these scripts directly.
